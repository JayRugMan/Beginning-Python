This is a page that discribes my website.
There are more lines than one, only becuase I need those 
lines to test my python script.

Who I Am

I'm just a *Joe Smoe* with a whole lot to say, but only a few outlets to say it. I have opinions
 that challenge orthodoxy and like to cook. If I had my way, Thomas Paine would have his.

What I Do

Manage a minecraft and plex server, an Arch-Linux-on-RaspberryPI jump box, and a small home network. 
All of the Operating Systems I run are Linux of some sort.
